# MAML Demo

This folder contains scripts for the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) process.

## Files

There are 2 files in this folder:

1. `image_maml.py`: This script implements the MAML algorithm for meta-learning using images as input data.

2. `image_train_model.py`: To train the MAML model, execute this script.

## Training the Model

To train the MAML model, run the `image_train_model.py` script with the following arguments:

```bash
python image_train_model.py --save_dir ./models --model_type metacnn --update_batch_size 128 --test_num_updates 1 --threshold 0 --meta_lr 1e-5 --update_lr 1e-5 --iterations 20000 --gpu_id 3
```

### Arguments:


- `save_dir`: The directory where trained models will be saved. Default is `./models`.

- `model_type`: The type of the model to be used. Default is 'metacnn'.

- `update_batch_size`: The batch size used for inner loop updates during MAML training. Default is 128.

- `test_num_updates`: The number of inner loop updates to be performed during testing. Default is 1.

- `threshold`: A threshold value for some specific purpose (not specified here). Default is 0.

- `meta_lr`: The learning rate for the meta-learner (outer loop) during MAML training. Default is 1e-5.

- `update_lr`: The learning rate for the inner loop updates during MAML training. Default is 1e-5.

- `iterations`: The total number of iterations (steps) for training. Default is 20000.

- `gpu_id`: The ID of the GPU to be used for training. Default is "3".

### Additional Notes:

- The script may have additional arguments commented out, such as `cluster_loss_weight` and `mem_dim`. These can be uncommented and set as needed for specific use cases.
